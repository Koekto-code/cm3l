refst->data.complex.parts[i].[begin - end] is equivalent to refst->data.complex.parts[i].begin - refst->data.complex.parts[i].end
but the refst->data.complex.parts[i] is saved as temporary variable
the idea is that any "valid variable identifier" inside is treated as a field.
also variables outside of the object can be added, but if there's none of fields, the parser throws an error.
to force resolve name inside [] outside of the object, it's placed inside round brackets, like:
mytable.obj.[begin + (localvar)];
